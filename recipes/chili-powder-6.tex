\ing[1]{gr.}{datil chile, dried and powdered}
Add the powdered datil just before use.
\freeform I used this powder with a beef and sausage chili.  The dried datil was from a jar from Joe at ``Bite Me Farms'' in St.\ Augustine, FL.  I think that I know now why no one uses sausage in their chili.  The powder is spicy, it made me sweat.  I cannot detect the special flavor of the datil pepper.  The chili was espescially red --- perhaps it was the pulla chiles.
