\begin{recipe}{Mustard \#1}{\unit[12]{oz}}{12 hours}
\ing[6]{tbsp}{black mustard seed, finely ground}
\ing[6]{tbsp}{black mustard seed, coarsely ground}
\ing[3]{tbsp}{``mustard powder''}
\ing[\fr12]{c.}{ice water}
\ing[1]{tsp}{salt}
Mix together and let sit for 10 minutes.
\ing[3]{tbsp}{white wine vinegar}
\ing[2]{tbsp}{honey}
Add the vinegar and honey. Stir.  Refrigerate covered for 12 hours.  Transfer to jars. 
\freeform The mustard can stay at room temperature almost indefinitely, especially if transferred to sterile jars. We used two year old Indian black mustard seed in this recipe and ground the mustard in a manual spice grinder. We expect this to be spicy. The next time, we will try some white mustard powder which should help balance out the spicy black mustard.
