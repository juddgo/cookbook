\begin{recipe}{Sam's Chili Powder \#7}{?}{\fr12 hour}
\ing[13]{gr.}{pulla chiles, dried\\(\unit[5--15]{kSc.})}
\ing[25]{gr.}{pasilla chiles, dried\\(\unit[1--4]{kSc.})}
\ing[18]{gr.}{coste\/home/sgy/{n}o rojo chiles, dried\\(\unit[7--10]{kSc.})}
\ing[1]{gr.}{datil chiles, dried\\(\unit[100--300]{kSc.})}
\ing[30]{gr.}{whole cumin seed}
Toast the sliced, stemmed and seeded chiles with the cumin for about \unit[3--4]{minutes} moving constantly.  Let chile and cumin cool.
\freeform It was difficult to weigh the datil accurately.  The scale we have doesn't have the precision we need.  It looked like a lot more than one gram.
\ing[1]{tsp}{garlic powder}
\ing[1]{tbsp}{dried oregano}
\ing[1]{tsp}{paprika}
Grind chiles and cumin along with other spices until a fine powder.
\freeform The datil chiles used in this recipe were bought dried and shredded from ``Bite Me Farms,'' St. Augustine, FL --- \url{http://joesbitemefarms.com/}. Joe does not remove the seeds before shredding the peppers.  I did my best to avoid seeds and membrame, but surely some made it in to the chili powder.\\
I made a chicken chili recipe with this powder.
