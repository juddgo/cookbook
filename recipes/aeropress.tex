\begin{recipe}{Coffee with an Aeropress\tm{} Coffee Maker}{1 serving}{5 minutes}
\freeform Julie gave Sam this contraption for his birthday in 2013.
It makes ``concentrated coffee'' although people are tempted to call
it espresso.  So far the results are mixed.  We don't have a scale
here at the beach so I have not been able to follow recipes precisely.
Also, the beans (L.B.I. opener) are from a tourist coffee shop, ground
for drip.
