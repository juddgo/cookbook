\freeform This chili powder turned out really well.  I made a chicken chili with \unit[\fr12]{c.} of powder and almost \unit[1\fr12]{lbs.} of ground chicken and barbecue turkey left over from Thanksgiving.  It was great and the spice was about right.  I would say medium, not hot.  Next time I would add a little more spice --- maybe some pequin.
