%% \ing[2]{lbs.}{beef, coarsely ground}
%% Form the ground beef into little balls, about the size of a \fr12-inch marble (This does not need to be perfect, so don't spend too much time doing this. The purpose is to emulate chili chuck, a very coarse grind of beef sold in Texas). In the same large pot, heat the meat, while stirring occasionally, until lightly browned on each side, about 10 minutes.
