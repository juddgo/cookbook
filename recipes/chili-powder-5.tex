\freeform I love it!  I made a batch of chicken chili with this chili powder, and it came out very well.  It may be the powder or it may be the fact that it was frozen and reheated.  I froze half and reheated it in a pot with \unit[12]{oz} of black lager.  Cooked on high heat until thawed, then simmered for about an hour to boil off whatever excess liquid there is.  It is spicy, but not uncomfortably spicy.  I had it served over rice last night with some powdered datil pepper, and it was fantastic.  All of this from achicken chili recipe that used chisken thigh, ground at home.  I am reluctant to say this, but i liked it better than the beef chili I made in Jax.
